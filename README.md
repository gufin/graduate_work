# üõ† Educational project

This is the graduate work for the course "Middle Python Developer". The goal of this project is to add a user profile 
service to an online cinema. In this service, the business offers to save sensitive information about a person: phone 
number and full name. The business will further use the phone number in marketing communications, to determine the 
uniqueness of the user, as well as for two-factor authorization.

1. Create a `.env` file and fill it with the values from `.env.example`.

    ```shell script
    cp ./.env.example ./.env
    ```

2. Run the project:

    ```shell script
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

3. Create a superuser:
    
    ```shell script
    docker-compose exec admin python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

4. Shut down all project containers:
    ```shell
    docker-compose stop
    ```

After successfully running all the above commands, you should have a fully configured application.

5. Running in development mode

    ```shell script
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
